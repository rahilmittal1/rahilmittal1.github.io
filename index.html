            <li>so that my linkedin bio has a personal website url like all the cool tech bros</li>
            <li>to make an internet museum for all my passions and shenanigans i have collected and continue to collect over the years (all media evidence can be found on my youtube channel)</li>

            i’ve been struggling with the concept of "self" for a while. i barely remember me anymore. sometimes i miss me.
            but that’s not a bad thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            because for my whole life, i derived my sense of identity strictly through my output.
            eventually i burnt myself out from the things i did that yielded this output. i tried everything to remember who i was. i couldn’t.
        </p>
        <p>
            i even went 10 days without speaking a single word. total silence without a phone or internet in the middle of a forest in illinois - 240 hours of undisturbed meditation in hopes of figuring out the self (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vipassana/comments/1lajwtk/how_do_you_describe_vipassana_to_people_who_have/">vipassana</a>).<br>
            that kinda helped tbh.
        </p>
        <p>
            i now find myself in a rabbit hole of… whatever you want to call it - spirituality? metaphysics? autism?

            i spent my entire teenage life trading crypto. at age 14, i made an amount of money that no 14 year old should get near. and then i lost most of it all. i’m not proud of it, but it was the most expensive education i ever received. i owe a lot of who i am to this teenage pursuit.
        </p>
        <p>
            i was a <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/fTDDJv385Cg?si=7TzrjO2SSSm1ZZ0U">drummer</a> and listened to a lot of music. i played the drums for 12 years and performed in front of thousands and taught a bunch of people along the way. fell out of love with the instrument one day in 2024. 
            in another life, i shall dust the dust off my drumsticks. until then, i must tend to the other relics in this museum.

            if you can't already tell, i say a lot of useless things. naturally, like every other guy with nothing important to say, i started a podcast.
